- Session 5 teaches us how to build the network from scratch
- We started with palcement of basic correct architecture
- Then we improved metwork with 5 iterations while keeping in ming the target accuracy, #parameters and #epochs
- We iteratively add batch norm, regularization, GAP layer, FC layer to improve the architecture iteratively
